- concurrency really help in both cpu and io bound tasks.
- multiple logical cpu(cpu threads) help drastically in cpu bound tasks.
- single logical cpu don't help much in cpu bound tasks even if program run concurrently.
- even a single logical cpu give great performance in I/O bound tasks if the program run concurrently.
